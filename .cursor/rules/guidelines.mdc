# Guidelines

- Use `uv` and avoid calling `python` or `pip` directly. Check help with `uv --help` if needed.
- Use `polars` and `httpx` instead of `pandas` and `requests`.
- Keep things Pythonic.
- Run the code and verify it works as expected.
- Docs are available at the `docs` folder. Check them.
